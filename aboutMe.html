                        I created this page to provide a more in-depth 
                        look at my background, goals, and experiences.

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>
                        I completed my undergrad at Santa Clara University in June, 2024 majoring 
                        in Computer Science and Engineering.
                        In the fall of the same year, I began a Master of Engineering program at
                        Dartmouth College, majoring in computer engineering.

                    <h3>Career Goals</h3>
                    <p>
                        My career goal is to bridge low-level hardware systems with high-level 
                        intelligent software, building robust and scalable technology solutions.
                        I’m also passionate about open-source collaboration and continuous learning.

                    <h3>Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        My experiences involved both hardware and software technologies, beginning
                        with C and C++. I used these two languages to learn core fundamentals and 
                        data structure algorithms. I then began to utilize Python for machine learning 
                        and natural language processing. In terms of hardware systems, I became extremely 
                        familiar with the Vivado design suite by Xilinx, upon which I programmed 
                        using Verilog and VHDL. My experience with hardware was augmented through my time working as a research assistant at Santa Clara
                        University's Internet of Things Lab. I am comfortable with the operating 
                        systems: Ubuntu, Linux, macOS, and Windows.
